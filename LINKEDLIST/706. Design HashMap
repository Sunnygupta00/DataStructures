BRUTE: USE FIXED SIZE ARRAY TO STORE THE VALUES (i.e is limit is 1000 make array of 10001 to store the values)

BETTER: 1) USE LINKEDLIST AND MAKE HEAD GLOBAL
        2) INSERTION: INSERT ALL THE ELEMENT
        3) GET : FIND THE ELEMENT IN THE LIST ELSE RETURN-1
        4) DELETE: TO DELETE ALWAYS ADD DUMMY NODE (-1) THEN REMOVE IT WITH THE HELP OF NEXT=NEXT.NEXT
